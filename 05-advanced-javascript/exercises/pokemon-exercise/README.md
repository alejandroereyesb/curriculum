### Summary
In this test we will develop a simple pokedex, that is, an app to consult the different types of pokemon and some features.

### Specifications
A simple webapp will be developed using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) pokemon API. The service has limited number of requests so use it carefully. In addition, you have a copy of the service also available under the URL http://pokeapi.salestock.net/api/v2/
The app must have the following characteristics:
- You must have a pokemon list, where at least your photo, name, number and type (or types) must appear
- The first at least 25 pokemon should appear (to have the detailed info of each one, we will have to make a request to the server and remember that there is a limit).
- Pokemon must be able to filter by name.
