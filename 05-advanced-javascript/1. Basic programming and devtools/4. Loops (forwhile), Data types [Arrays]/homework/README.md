### Exercise 1 - Replace Text

- Replace this code with a for loop that does the exact same thing
- Replace this code with a while loop that does the exact same thing

```javascript
console.log("I have 0 sandwich");
console.log("I have 1 sandwich");
console.log("I have 2 sandwich");
console.log("I have 3 sandwich");
console.log("I have 4 sandwich");
console.log("I have 5 sandwich");
console.log("I have 6 sandwich");
console.log("I have 7 sandwich");
```


### Exercise 2 - Replace operation

- Replace this code with a for loop that does the exact same thing
- Replace this code with a while loop that does the exact same thing

```javascript
console.log("2 x 0 = 0");
console.log("2 x 1 = 2");
console.log("2 x 2 = 4");
console.log("2 x 3 = 6");
console.log("2 x 4 = 8");
console.log("2 x 5 = 10");
console.log("2 x 6 = 12");
console.log("2 x 7 = 14");
console.log("2 x 8 = 16");
console.log("2 x 9 = 18");
console.log("2 x 10 = 20");
```

### Exercise 2 - sum

 - Write a program to add the values of an array.
It isn't mandatory to use loops for this exercises.


```javascript
 let array = [2,5,8,10,100,3,6,20]
```

### Exercise 3 - Draw
Draw the next character with "for"
```
*
**
***
****
*****
******
*******
********
*********
```

### Exercise 4 - while
    Review: While. Loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

- 4.1 Copy the following code and see how it works
```javascript

    let number = 0;
    while(number !== 8){
        number = number +1
    }
    console.log(number+" is eight");
```


- 4.2 Copy the following code and see how it works.
This code only finishes when you answer correctly.
```javascript

    let response = "";
    while(response !== "yes"){
       response = prompt("Is programming fun?");
    }
    console.log("yes, programming is fun");
```

- 4.3. Now, create your own code that only finishes when it hits a condition you have specified.

Use a while loop to write code that only finish when you correctly answer two questions

### Exercise 5 - Array + "for".	
 When you use loop and and array, we obtain one powerful tool.	

 - First, review length:	

 - The **length** accessor property represents the length (in elements) of a typed array.	

 Example	
```javascript	
    let shoppingList = ["bananas","pineapple","water melon","fruit juice"];	
     //show you have 4 items in the shopping list.	
    console.log("you have "+shoppingList.length+" items in the shopping list.");	
```	

 Now, you can use length with loops.	
Copy the next code and understand how it works.	
```javascript	
    let shoppingList = ["bananas","pineapple","water melon","fruit juice"];	
     for(let i = 0; i < shoppingList.length; i++){	
        console.log(i);	
        console.log(shoppingList[i]);	
        console.log("in my shopping list, I have:"+shoppingList[i]);	
    }	
```

### Exercise 6 - For loops + Arrays + Concatenating strings

- Using the array named `colors`, write a for loop that replaces the `console.logs below
```javascript
 let colors = ["Blue ", "Green", "Red", "Orange", "Violet", "Indigo", "Yellow "];

```

```javascript
 console.log("1. Is Green your favorite color?");
 console.log("2. Is Red your favorite color?");
 console.log("3. Is Orange your favorite color?");
 console.log("4. Is Violet your favorite color?");
 console.log("5. Is Indigo your favorite color?");
 console.log("6. Is Yellow  your favorite color?");
```

### Exercise 7 - Arrays (you can do it without loops)

- Given an empty array named `colors`, add 3 colors to it, print it on console, remove two of them, and print it again
```javascript
 let colors = [];
```

### Exercise 8 - For loops + Arrays

- Given this array of ages. 
1. Print the sum of all ages
2. Print the sum of the odd ages (not sum the even).
3. Print how many ages are odd 
```javascript
 let ages = [18,19,20,51,5,25,14,31,40,26,99];
```

### Exercise 9 - Transfer of content between arrays

- Given this two arrays of colors, transfer the content of the first array in the second and viceversa
```javascript
 let colors1 = ["blue","white"];
 let colors2 = ["green","red"];
```

Dont hesitate to ask teachers!!
