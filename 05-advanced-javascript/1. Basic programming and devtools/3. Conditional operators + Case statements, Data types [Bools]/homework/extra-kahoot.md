## Important
To complete this exercise, you'll need to use both **alert** and **prompt** methods.
Use the template to do your exercises.

- **prompt(message, defaultOption)** displays a popup with an optional message prompting the user to input some text.
  The second parameter is optional. If you provide a default option, this will be the default value of the text input.

Example:
```javascript
     let name = prompt("Please enter your name", "Harry Potter");
     console.log(name);

     let response = prompt("How are you?");
     console.log(response);
```

- The **alert(message)** method displays an alert dialog with the optional specified content and an OK button.

Example:
```javascript
    alert("this is one message");
```
