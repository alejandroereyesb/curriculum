# Advanced CSS

## Custom Properties
**Custom properties** (sometimes referred to as CSS variables) are variables defined by CSS authors that contain specific values to be reused throughout a document (similar to JS variables). They are set using custom property notation (e.g., `--main-color: black;`) and are accessed using the var() function (e.g., `color: var(--main-color);`).

Complex websites have very large amounts of CSS, often with a lot of repeated values. For example, the same color might be used in hundreds of different places, requiring global search and replace if that color needs to change. Custom properties allow a value to be stored in one place, then referenced in multiple other places.

### Using variables

```css
.parent-element {
    --main-color: #000;
} 

.child-element {
    background: var(--main-color);
}

/* Custom properties using fallback value */
.sibling-element[attr] {
    background: var(--main-color, #fff);
}

```

## Updating the value from javascript

```javascript
const element = document.querySelector('.parent-element');
element.style.setProperty("--main-color", "pink");
```

## Class naming methodology [BEM]

On smaller sites, how you organize your styles isnâ€™t usually a big concern. However, in larger projects, how you organize your code is key. Nowadays, most of the companies use at least one method of CSS naming methodology to ensure performance, structure and maintanibility.

BEM is the abbreviation of **Block, Element, Modifier**:

- **Block**: Standalone entity that is meaningful on its own (header, menu, input),
- **Element**: A part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block. (header -> title, menu -> item)
- **Modifier**: Use them to change appearance or behavior. (header -> title -> active, menu -> item -> highlighted)

### Using BEM

```html
<button class="button">
	Normal button
</button>
<button class="button button--state-success">
	Success button
</button>
<button class="button button--state-danger">
	Danger button
</button>
```

```css
.button {
	display: inline-block;
	border-radius: 3px;
	padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem;
	border: 1px solid #D5D5D5;
	background-image: linear-gradient(#EEE, #DDD);
	font: 700 13px/18px Helvetica, arial;
}
.button--state-success {
	color: #FFF;
	background: #569E3D linear-gradient(#79D858, #569E3D) repeat-x;
	border-color: #4A993E;
}
.button--state-danger {
	color: #900;
}
```

## Caniuse && Feature Queries
Not every CSS and JS feature is supported for every browser. Some projects may require to support an old version of a browser and we might not be able to use this feature. It is very important to ensure that the browsers we expect our customers are going to use are supported by our code. 
"Can I use" provides up-to-date browser support tables for support of front-end web technologies on desktop and mobile web browsers.

For example, can I use flexbox in every browser?
No, some browsers like [Internet Explorer 11 do not support standard CSS flexbox](https://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox)

In case a browser does not support a feature, we can query if the browser does support this feature and offer an alternative:

```css

div {
    display: flex;
}

@supports (display: grid) {
  div {
    display: grid;
  }
}

```
