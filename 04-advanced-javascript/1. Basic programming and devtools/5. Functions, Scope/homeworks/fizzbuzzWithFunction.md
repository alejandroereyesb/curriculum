# FizzBuzz exercise again.

You do this exercise again but now you know functions.
You try one different way solution with function.
An advice when you think that you finish you take one moment and think if you can imagine one better solution.

The solution is [solution](https://github.com/mfrcodingproject/curriculum/blob/master/03-javascript/1.%20Basic%20programming%20and%20devtools/5.%20Functions%2C%20Scope/homeworks/solution_fizzbuzzWithFunction.md)

With this exercise, you'll be practicing both `if...else` and conditional structures.
You'll need to use the usual prompt and alert methods that you've been using in class.

##### Rules

- Prompt the user for a number
- If the number is divisible by 3, you should alert `Fizz!`
  - (3, 6, 9, 12, etc are divisible by 3)
- If the number is divisible by 5, you should alert `Buzz!`
  - (5, 10, 20, etc are divisible by 5)
- If the number is divisible both by 3 **and** 5, you should alert `FizzBuzz!`
  - (15, 30, 45, etc are divisible by 5 **and** 3)
- Solve this the exercise both with `if...else` and `switch` conditional structures.
