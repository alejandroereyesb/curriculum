Working with variables

Exercise 1 - The fortune teller
------------------- 

The idea of this exercise is to show in the console a message which talks about your future fortune in some profession:

Example message output: "You will be Teacher in New York and working with Bill Gates in 3 different projects"

Store the following into variables "let": `number of projects`, `partner's name`, `geographic location`, `job title`.

```
Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and working with Z in N different projects."
```

Exercise 2 - The Lifetime Supply Calculator
------------------

Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!
```
- Store your current age into a variable.
- Store a maximum age into a variable.
- Store an estimated amount per day (as a number).
- Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life.
- Output the result to the screen by console like so: "You will need NN to last  you until the ripe old age of X". 
```



###Details to be considered
    - first you can do it directly in the html but ideally you work this exercise by running the javascript in a separate file.
    - you should use the template to execute your javascript code.


```javascript
function Main {
	this.execute = function (){ 
		//this is one comment
		//your code
		console.log("Hello world");
	}
}
new Main().execute();
```
