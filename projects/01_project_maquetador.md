Our fist project will only consist of HTML and CSS and, at the end of the course we will add some DOM manipulation with JS.

## Objective

So, congratulations, you have become entrepreneurs!! So… now what? Don’t be scared, you’re not going off the path into uncharted territory. 

You should create a website for your company. Everything, including: name, type of company, design, fonts, website strucutre, navigation...etc. should be decided by the group. However, it has to meet some basic requirements.
